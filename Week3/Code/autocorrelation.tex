	\section{Results}
	The correlation between successive years is 0.326169651060742.
	And the fraction of the correlation coefficients from the 10000 calculations that is greater than correlation 
    between successive years is $2\times 10^{-4}$.
	
	\section{Analysis}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item HO : temperatures of one year does NOT correlated with the next year 
            \item H1 : temperatures of one year significantly correlated with the next year 
        \end{itemize}

	The p value, which is the fraction of the correlation coefficients from the 10000 calculations that is greater than correlation between successive years,
    is small than 0.0005 so we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis.

    The result is significant. The temperatures of one year is significantly correlated with the next year with correlation equals to 0.326169651060742.
