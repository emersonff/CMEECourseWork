# Week 2: Biological Computing in R and Data Management, Exploration and Visualization
all R script can be run using  `source()` under **Rstudio** environment or using `Rscript` command in bash ternimal.

## Biological Computing in R
In this chapter, We learned basic senmantics of R, R data structures and how to write and execute R script etc.

basic_io.R: A simple script to illustrate R input-output.   
control_flow.R: Demonstrates how to use conditional statements.   
break.R: How to break out of a loop.   
next.R: How to skip to next iteration of a loop.   
boilerplate.R: boilerplate of R script.   
TreeHeight.R: calculates heights of trees and save the results in `TreeHts.csv`   
Vectorize1.R: sum all elements in a matrix.   
preallocate.R: How to preallocate a matrix to seed up.   
apply1.R: How to use `apply` function.   
apply2.R: How to use `apply` function.   
sample.R: Sampling using loops, `lapply` and `sapply`.   
Ricker.R: The Ricker model.   
Vectorize2.R: Vectirization version of the stochastic Ricker model.   
Vectorize1.py: python version of Vectorize1.R.   
Vectorize2.py: python version of Vectorize2.R.   
vectorize.sh: run 4 vectorize script and compare running time.   
try.R: How to suppress any error messages using `try`.   
browse.R: How to enter brower mode for debugging using `browser()`.   
TAutoCorr.R: Practical Autocorrelation in weather.   
get_TreeHeight.R: Calculates tree heights using a csv file as input and save the results.   
get_TreeHeight.py: python version of get_TreeHeight.R.   
run_get_TreeHeight.sh: tests get_TreeHeight.R and get_TreeHeight.py









## Data Management, Exploration and Visualization
In this chapter, We learned how to do data wrangling and how to visualise data using `ggplot2` package.
