Predicting Microbial growth patterns is crucial in the field of microbiology and its relevant industry such as the food industry. Predictive modelling plays an important role in detecting shelf life or food spoilage. Thus, it is crucial to select a model best describing the microbial growth data under a certain environment. In this study, 4 previously published sigmoidal functions(the Logistic model, the Gompertz model, the Baranyi model as well as the Buchanan model) were proposed to fit a collection of bacterial growth data collected other journals. All models were used in their modified form. 4 different model selection methods including RSS, AIC,BIC, and AICc were proposed during the experiment. the modified Gompertz model was capable of fitting $92.1\%$ of the dataset. By using RSS along with AICc, it was concluded that the Gompertz model best fitted the empirical bacterial growth data.
