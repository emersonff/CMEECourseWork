abstract = "Techniques for the development of mathematical models in the area of predictive microbiology have greatly improved recently, allowing better and more accurate descriptions of microbial responses to particular environmental conditions, thus enabling predictions of those responses to be made with greater confidence. Recognising the potential value of applying these techniques in the food industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) initiated a nationally coordinated five-year programme of research into the growth and survival of microorganisms in foods, with the aim of developing a computerised Predictive Microbiology Database in the UK. This initiative has resulted in the systematic generation of data, through protocols which ensure consistency of methodology, so that data in the database are truly comparable and compatible, and lead to reliable predictive models. The approaches taken by scientists involved in this programme are described and the various stages in the development of mathematical models summarized. It is hoped that this initiative and others being developed in the USA, Australia, Canada and other countries, will encourage a more integrated approach to food safety which will influence all stages of food production and, eventually, result in the development of an International Predictive Microbiology Database."

abstract = "The objective of this work was to explore the large number of bacterial growth models recently proposed in the field of predictive microbiology, concerning their capacity to give reliable estimates of the lag phase duration (位). We compared these models on the basis of their underlying biological explanations of the lag phenomenon, their mathematical formulation and their statistical fitting properties. Results show that a variety of biological interpretations of the lag phase exists, although different biological hypotheses sometimes converge to give identical mathematical equations. The fit of the different models provides relatively close 位 estimates, especially if we consider that the imprecision of the 位 estimates is generally larger than the differences between the models. In addition, the consistency of the 位 estimates closely depends on the quality of the dataset on which models were fitted."
